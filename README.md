# Generative-Algorithm-Knitting_Kiko
Coding and knitting shares an interesting bond. This piece uses processing sketch as a textile surface, explores generative knitting with algorithms.  Based on Langton's Ant, a two-dimensional universal Turing machine invented by Chris Langton in 1986, a very simple algorithm that can lead to complex patterns after running over thousands steps, I created several generative Processing sketches by changing only one or two constant in this algorithm, which results in creating many intriguing patterns that simulate the process of knitting. You can also use the mouse to interact with the screen to warp the rules in real-time, which will result in generating different patterns.
